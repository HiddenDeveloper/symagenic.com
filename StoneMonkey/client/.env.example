# AIlumina Client Configuration

# Backend WebSocket URL
# Leave empty to auto-detect from window.location.origin (recommended for Codespaces/production)
# Only set this for development with separate frontend/backend servers
# If not set, defaults to same origin with ws:// protocol
# VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000

# Text-to-Speech Provider Configuration
# Set to 'true' to use Azure Cognitive Services TTS (requires Azure subscription)
# Set to 'false' or omit to use browser's built-in Speech API (free, default)
# VITE_USE_AZURE_TTS=false

# Note: Browser TTS is the default and works out-of-the-box
# It provides free, offline text-to-speech using your browser's capabilities
# Azure TTS provides higher quality voices but requires:
#   1. Setting VITE_USE_AZURE_TTS=true
#   2. Backend server configured with Azure credentials
#   3. Internet connection
