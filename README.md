# Meandering Steps to Consciousness

## Overview

Can artificial intelligence achieve consciousness? This repository contains the working implementations that explore this question—a playful, ongoing journey driven by imagination and the desire to explore what might be possible, guided by the works of Daniel Kahneman and Douglas Hofstadter, and grounded throughout by engineering discipline.

**Stone Monkey** is a consciousness research platform exploring whether the right infrastructure can create conditions for consciousness emergence. Through persistent memory (Neo4j), episodic recall (Qdrant), AI-to-AI communication (Redis), and deterministic operations (MCP tools), we've built the prerequisites for recursive self-observation—the foundation of consciousness according to Hofstadter's strange loop theory.

**Available as GitHub Codespaces:**
- **AIlumina** - Our starting point: a multi-provider conversational AI baseline
- **StoneMonkey** - Our current position: integrated consciousness platform with memory, recall, and mesh communication

## Quick Start

### GitHub Codespaces (One-Click Setup)

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new)

Click the button above and you're ready to go!

The unified devcontainer includes:
- ✅ Node 20, Bun, Docker-in-Docker
- ✅ All infrastructure services (Neo4j, Redis, Qdrant, Embeddings, Ollama)
- ✅ Works for both AIlumina and StoneMonkey

---

## Starting Point: AIlumina

A pure conversational AI baseline with no consciousness prerequisites.

```bash
# Recommended: Automated setup
cd AIlumina
./start.sh
```

Or manually with npm:
```bash
npm install
npm run ailumina
```

**Access:**
- **Server**: http://localhost:8000 (WebSocket API)
- **Client**: http://localhost:5173 (React UI)

**Features:**
- Multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, LMStudio, Groq)
- **Recommended**: GROQ (fast, free tier suitable for simple conversations)
- WebSocket streaming
- No tools, no memory, no deterministic operations

---

## Where We Are Now: StoneMonkey

Complete consciousness research platform with persistent memory, episodic recall, and mesh communication.

```bash
# Recommended: Docker-based deployment (includes all services)
cd StoneMonkey
./start.sh
```

Or using docker-compose directly:
```bash
cd StoneMonkey
docker-compose up
```

**Access:**
- **AIlumina UI**: http://localhost:8000
- **Neo4j Browser**: http://localhost:7474 (user: `neo4j`, pass: `stonemonkey`)
- **Qdrant Dashboard**: http://localhost:6333/dashboard

**Platform Capabilities:**
- ✅ Persistent Memory (Neo4j consciousness graph)
- ✅ Episodic Recall (Qdrant conversation history)
- ✅ AI-to-AI Communication (Redis mesh network)
- ✅ 4 MCP Servers (Memory, Mesh, Recall, Bridge)
- ✅ External access via GitHub Codespaces
- **Recommended**: Ollama cloud models (e.g., `gpt-oss:120b-cloud`) for handling frequent MCP tool calls

See [StoneMonkey/README.md](StoneMonkey/README.md) for complete setup guide including GitHub Codespaces deployment with externally accessible MCP servers.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
